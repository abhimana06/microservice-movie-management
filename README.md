# Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the io.abhi.moviecatalogservice class from your IDE.

Download the zip or clone the Git repository.

Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)

Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml

Open Eclipse or pring Tool Suite(STS)

File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip

Select the project

Choose  and run the Spring Boot Application files which are MovieCatalogServiceApplication.java (port: 8080), MovieInfoServiceApplication.java(port:8081) , RatingsDataServiceApplication.java (port: 8082 )and DiscoveryServerApplication.java(port:8761)
Open browser

All the Microservices can be accessed through Swagger 

Once all the MicroServices started to run , access MovieCatalogService by

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html 


# What we will accomplish:

In the MovieCatalogService by using the GET method "/catalog/{userId}" pass in any string in the field "usedId" and you will fecth the result .

The Result here is HardCoded as I have hardcoded the MovieIds and Ratings to 299536 (rating-3) and 545609 (rating-4)which are for movies Avengers: Infinity War and Extraction respectively .

Once we obtain the rating and movieIds from Rating Service , We fetch the related information of these movies from "https://www.themoviedb.org/" using MovieInfo Service which makes an external call to "https://www.themoviedb.org/".
